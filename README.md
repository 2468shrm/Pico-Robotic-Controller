# Pico-Robotic-Controller
A carrier board for a Raspberry Pi Pico (W) for use in FRC robotics. Similar to the XRP board.

## Introduction (Motivation)

You may assume that this board is indended to compete with the XRP product from 
WPI, other developers, and SparkFun. __It is not__. The XRP board is awesome and
 I'll likely end up acquiring one (or two) for myself. I have been working on lo
w-cost, roboRIO-like carrier boards for FRC for a couple of years.

Why create a carrier board like the roboRIO? To enable a lower-cost prototyping solution. This solution makes it less risky to a costly than using a roboRIO solution. Breaking a roboRIO means costly replacement that is sometimes hard to replace. One goal was to provide as many similar interfaces as possible but cost 25% the budget.

Things I didn't need to do with my use model: support LabVIEW despite being a team who lives and breaths LabVIEW. I did want to support rapid prototyping and so exploring circuitpython was a goal; particularly because of the library support for the STEMMA QT/Qwiic based sensors available from Adafruit.

## Board Features

The carrier board has the following interfaces and features.

- RaspberryPi Pico W board
  - Does the thinking
  - Provides WiFi and/or Bluetooth
  - Socketed for replacemnt if needed
- Adafruit Picobell CAN board (optional)
  - Provides CAN connectivity for integration into FRC robots allowing CAN-connected applications (e.g. smart sensors)
- Adafruit Ethernet Featherwing board (optional)
  - Provides Ethernet connectivity for integration into FRC robots allowing Ethernet connected applications (e.g. smart sensors)
- Power
  - 12V Battery input provides main board supply
    - 5V regulator [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JZ5FVLC), OR
    - A connection to external 5V regulator (using WAGO 250-202) connector if the 5V supply current requirements are higher than the module can provide
  - Servo/PWM interface independently powered by an external source
    - Due to the potential need for different voltage and higher current
    - Not needed if connecting to external motor controllers (REV, CTRE, etc.)
- Four (4) STEMMA QT/Qwiic connections provided through a 4-port I2C switch run off the Pico W I2C 1 interface
- Eight (8) Servo PWM interfaces and an additional 8 PWM signals generated by a 16-channel generator connected to the Pico W I2C 0 interface
  - The Servo PWM interace has its own power input; for increased voltage or current for high-torque servo motors
- Two (2) analog input (ADC) ports, 3V maximum
- Eight (8) digital I/O ports, divided into 2 4-pin groups
  - Uses the roboRIO DIO 3-pin interface
  - Each group provides jumper-selectable power (5V or 3.3V)
  - Pico inputs are 3.3V only (maximum) input, with level shifting based on the group's selected power
  - All DIOs have LEDs to indicate logic level (Dark is LOW, Illuminated is HIGH)
- One NEOPIXEL interface for providing visual sensor status or communication
- One on-board single-pixel NEOPIXEL for board status

## Comparison to XRP Board

The XRP board has some significant philospohical and design choices and features.

- Was designed with the intent of learning robotics on a small platform, using the WPILib framework
- Has four motor controllers (1.5A each) integrated on the board
- Has a gyro and accelerometer integrated on the board
- The connectors are six-position JST (vertical) that integrates digital I/Os for encoders in addition to the M+ and M- motor signals
