# Pico-Robotic-Controller
A carrier board for a Raspberry Pi Pico (W) for use in FRC robotics. Similar to the XRP board.

## Introduction (Motivation)

You may assume that this board is indended to compete with the XRP product
from WPI, other developers, and SparkFun. __It is not__. The XRP board is
awesome and I'll likely end up acquiring one (or two) for myself. I have
been working on lo w-cost, roboRIO-like carrier boards for FRC for a couple
of years.

Why create a carrier board like the roboRIO? To enable a lower-cost
prototyping solution. This solution makes it less risky to a costly
than using a roboRIO solution. Breaking a roboRIO means costly replacement
that is sometimes hard to replace. One goal was to provide as many
similar interfaces as possible but cost 25% the budget.

Things I didn't need to do with my use model: support LabVIEW despite being
a team who lives and breaths LabVIEW. I did want to support rapid prototyping
and so exploring circuitpython was a goal; particularly because of the
library support for the STEMMA QT/Qwiic based sensors available from
Adafruit.

## Comparison to XRP Board

The XRP board has some significant philospohical and design choices and features.

- XRP was designed with the intent of learning robotics on a small platform, using the WPILib framework
- Includes four motor controllers (1.5A each) integrated on the PCB
- Has a gyro and accelerometer integrated on the PCB
- The connectors are six-position JST (vertical) that integrates digital I/Os for encoders in addition to the M+ and M- motor signals (i.e. not a sensor standard like Qwiic or STEMMA QT)

The PRC does not include any motor controllers on the board. However, it does provide a 2x5 pin connector and a dedicated PWM generator (I2C bus 0, address 0x1). The intent is to provide a board with 4 12V, 3.3 A motor controllers using a separate/dedicated battery input. Providing the capability to drive four H-Bridges allows for demonstration chassis (skid steer or Meccanum). This allows replaceable solutions as well as future upgrades for higher current. Moreover, the PWM / Servo connections allow for use of a conventional FRC PWM-controlled motor controller.

The PRC provides four STEMMA QT / Qwiic connectors in lieu of a specific set of sensors (IMU). This allows out use of different sensors dependent on the application.

The PRC also has CAN and Ethernet connectivity in addition to the WiFi and BlueTooth provided by the Pice W board.

## PRC Board Detail / Theory of Operation

The following describes the PRC board components, features, and 

When exploring the board's detail and function, it may be helpful to refer to
the board's schematic ([Link](https://github.com/2468shrm/Pico-Robotic-Controller/blob/main/Images/Pico%20Robotic%20Controller%20Schematic.pdf)).

### Main Power / Battery Input

The power system has the following components:
- +BATT - The main power supply (+BATT) is connected to J1, a 2-position WAGO 250 series connector. The typical use is a 12V battery or power supply.
- +12V - Connected to +BATT through a diode-capacitor filter. The intent of the filter is to avoid brownouts on the robot from affecting board performance.
- +5V - The Pico W uses a 5V source normally supplied by USB's VBUS. However, the board provides a 5V source. This is done via either installing a 5V 3A regulator module ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JZ5FVLC)), or by installing a 2-position WAGO 250-series connector (J11) and providing an external 5V supply.  The external solution would be used only in situations where 3A is insufficient (e.g. a very long NEOPIXEL strip).
- VSYS - VSYS is a pin on the Pico W board that is sourced from VBUS through a Schottky diode, but this is only functional when the VBUS is connected.  VSYS is also soured by a PFET (Q1, a DMG2305UX-13) as recommended by the Pico W datasheet ([Raspberry Pi Pico W Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf#page=15)). Refer to sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the datasheet for details. This allows a computer connected via VBUS at the same time the board is powred by +BATT (or the J11 external source).
- VBUS - The USB OTG's power pin. Note that J6 is provided (and needs to have a jumper installed)  in order to source VBUS from the board's +5V supply when the USB OTG interface is being used in HOST mode.

### Processing and Communications
The PRC is intended to serve as a low-cost roboRIO.  To that end it includes
computation and communication at the heart of the system.

#### Pi Pico W
The PRC includes a socket to install a Raspberry Pi Pico W board. This is in component designator U2.

#### CAN  
The PRC includes a socket to install an Adafruit Picowbell board
([link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5728)). This board uses a Microchip
MCP2515 SPI to CAN device. This is an optional device; the PRC can opeate with
CAN, Ethernet, Both, or none.

The CAN and Ethernet boards share the same SPI MOSI, MISO, and SCK signals, but
have independent chips selects (and in the case of CAN a separate interrupt
signal).

#### Ethernet
The PRC includes a socket to install an Adafruit Ethernet Featherwing
([link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3201)).This is an optional device;
the PRC can opeate with CAN, Ethernet, Both, or none.

The CAN and Ethernet boards share the same SPI MOSI, MISO, and SCK signals, but
have independent chips selects.

### Sensors
There are multiple digital and analog sensor connection methods used with the PRC
board. These include a number of I2C interfaces that use the Qwiic/STEMMA QT format,
analog inputs, and digital I/Os.

#### Qwiic / STEMMA QT
There are four (4) Qwiic/STEMMA QT connectors. These connectors (X1-X4) connect
to the Pico W I2C bus 1 via an TCA9546 4-port I2C switch/mux (I2C bus 1 address 0x70).

The Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector provide the two I2C signals (each connector coming
from one dedicated output of the I2C mux/switch), 3.3V, and GND. This format
connector assumes the attached device provides the SDA/SCL pull ups and any local
level shifting to the sensor. It also assumes the board provides 3.3V conversion
to the sensor used. Each Qwiic/STEMMA QT connection may chain multiple sensors
provided their I2C addresses do not collide and the signal integrity of the I2C
signals is maintained.

The Qwiic/STEMMA QT to mux/switch channel is provided in the following table.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>SCL2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### ADC / Analog Input
There are two (2) analog input pins that connect to the Pico W ADC0 and ADC1
pins. The board buffers the input signals between pin and Pico W ADC inputs with
a unity gain opamp.  This is done to provide the highest accuracy while allowing
the use of sensors with larger output impedances.

The ADCs use a 3x2 pin header, and uses the same pin layout as the roboRIO's AIN
connections; signal, power, and ground. Ground is closest to the board edge and
power in the middle. The power pin voltage is 3.3V since the Pico W ADC range is
0 to 3.3 V.

#### Digital Input/Output (DIO)
There are eight (8) DIOs arranged in two groups of four, DIO0-3 and DIO4-7.
Each group has an independent level shifter (TXS0104E). The level shifter
includes 10 kΩ pull ups. Since the Pico W has 3.3V (only) I/Os, the VCCA of both
level shifters use 3.3 V. However the VCCB of the external side of each level
shifter is set by an external jumper (J5 for DIO0-3 and J9 for DIO4-7) and
can be set to either 3.3 V or 5 V.

Each DIO group uses a 3x4 pin header, and uses the same pin layout as the roboRIO's
DIO connections; signal, power, and ground. Ground is closest to the board edge
and power in the middle. The power pin voltage is the same voltage pdovided
to the VCCB of the level shifter.

### Motor Control
There are two main interfaces for 
#### PWM / Servo

#### Motor Control

In the PWM Generation Channels section (above), four (4) motor channels (M0-M3) are referenced. The top 8 outputs of the PWM generator IC are assigned to a low-current motor control board.  This board is basically four (4) instances of the TI DRV8870 3.5 A motor controller. This board is intended to be used in FIRST Tech Challenge class robots for classroom and learning (not competition) use. 

The DRV8870 has 2 signal inputs per IC (IN1, IN2).  The motor controller operates as follows:

<table>
  <tr style="background-color:#404040">
    <th>IN1</th>
    <th>IN2</th>
    <th>OUT 1</th>
    <th>OUT 2</th>
    <th>Motor Action </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>High-Z</td>
    <td>High-Z</td>
    <td><u>Coast</u><br />Current direction remains and flows through reverse body diodes of H-bridge. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>GND</td>
    <td>VDD</td>
    <td><u>Reverse</u><br />Current flows from OUT 2 to OUT 1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>VDD</td>
    <td>GND</td>
    <td><u>Forward</u><br /> Current flows from OUT 1 to OUT 2.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>GND</td>
    <td>GND</td>
    <td><u>Brake</u><br />Current recirculates between low-side H-bridge.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: When pulse width modulating the IN1 & IN2 to provide speed control of the attached motors, it is important to realize that operating in coast or brake modes is important to consider.

In coast mode, the motor coasts when both IN1 and IN2 are 0. This matches the normal signal polarity of a PWM signal (high represents active).

<table>
  <tr style="background-color:#404040">
    <th>Mode</th>
    <th>Direction</th>
    <th>IN1</th>
    <th>IN2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Coast</td>
    <td>Forward</td>
    <td>PWM'd</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reverse</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>PWM'd</td>
  </tr>
</table>
The PWM will drive the motor fur the duration of the high time of the duty cycle and coast through the low time.

In brake mode, the motor breaks when both IN1 and IN2 are 1. This is opposite the normal signal polarity of a PWM signal, so the signal generation needs to be inverted and the low-time needs to represent the desired fraction of the output. Also, the PWM'd input signal must be swapped so that the correct direction is maintained.
<table>
  <tr style="background-color:#404040">
    <th>Mode</th>
    <th>Direction</th>
    <th>IN1</th>
    <th>IN2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Coast</td>
    <td>Forward</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>inverse PWM'd</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reverse</td>
    <td>Inverse PWM'd</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Also note this is a not the PWM encoding used for servo controls. The PWM
modulation applied to IN1 and IN2 is full duty cycle of the signal's period
(not the first 2 ms of 20 ms signal).

### Status

The PRC provides simple interfaces for visual status.

#### NEOPIXEL on PCB

A single NEOPIXEL device is mounted on the board. This is intended to provide
visual status while developing code or tuning algodrithms and mechanisms.

#### NEOPIXEL Strip

A 3-position 250-series WAGo connector is provided to connect a NEOPIXEL strip
to the board. This is intended to provide visual status for distant observation.
The most common use case being robot to driver status across the FRC field.

### PCB Layer Usage

The PRC PCB uses four layers primarily to keep power distribution as clean
as possible. The layers are used as described in the following table. Each
layer label includes a link to the layer's image.
